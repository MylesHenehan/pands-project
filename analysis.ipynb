    "This project consists of an exploration of the Iris Data Set, using Python to examine its attributes and form a conclusion about the data contained within. There will be 3 main aims to this project; the first will be to identify the variables present in the data set and export each of them to a single text file. The second approach will be to produce representations of said variables in the form of histograms, and save them as png files. Finally, we will produce a scatter plot of each of the variables, and conclude by providing any other relevant analysis that may be of interest to someone investigating this data set.\n"

    "First introduced in 1936 by British statistician Ronald Fisher in his paper titled \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems,\" the Iris Data set is a staple in the field of machine learning and statistics, and serves as a simple, straightforward source of data through which beginners in the field of data analytics can build up their knowledge.\n",

    "The data set contains 150 instances, split evenly between 3 different types (otherwise known as classes) of Iris flower. These types are setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Moreover, each flower has 4 different features (known as variables): sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. This combination of classes and variables gives students in the field of data science a simple yet all-encompassing set of data through which to explore data representation using Python."
