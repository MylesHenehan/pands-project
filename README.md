# Investigation of the Iris Dataset

## Project Summary
This project consists of an exploration of the Iris Data Set, using Python to examine its attributes and form a conclusion about the data contained within. There will be 3 main aims to this project; the first will be to identify the variables present in the data set and export each of them to a single text file. The second approach will be to produce representations of said variables in the form of histograms, and save them as png files. Finally, we will produce a scatter plot of each of the variables, and conclude by providing any other relevant analysis that may be of interest to someone investigating this data set.

## Background of the Dataset
First introduced in 1936 by British statistician Ronald Fisher in his paper titled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems," the Iris Data set is a staple in the field of machine learning and statistics, and serves as a simple, straightforward source of data through which beginners in the field of data analytics can build up their knowledge.

The data set contains 150 instances, split evenly between 3 different types (otherwise known as classes) of Iris flower. These types are setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Moreover, each flower has 4 different features (known as variables): sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. This combination of classes and variables gives students in the field of data science a simple yet all-encompassing set of data through which to explore data representation using Python.
